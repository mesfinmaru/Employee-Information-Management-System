## 🧮 Payroll Logic (Built-in)

### ✔ Position Allowance

| Position                                | Allowance     |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| CEO                                     | 10% of salary |
| COO / CTO / CISO / Director / Dept Head | 0%            |
| Other Employees                         | 0%            |

### ✔ Transport Allowance

* CEO & management → **2220 (non-taxable)**
* Others → **600 (taxable)**

### ✔ Ethiopian Income Tax

```
0–600        = 0
601–1650     = 10%  - 60
1651–3200    = 15%  - 142.5
3201–5250    = 20%  - 302.5
5251–7800    = 25%  - 565
7801–10900   = 30%  - 965
10901+       = 35%  - 1500
```

### ✔ Pension (Full-Time Only)

* Employee: **7%** of basic salary
* Employer: **11%** of basic salary
